# ultinvim
An attempt at The Ultimate Nvim Configuration™ with focus on Rails development.  
Insipred by Astrail's [dotvim](https://github.com/astrails/dotvim).
### Installation
This configuration was built and tested on OS X El Capitan, *iTerm2 Build 2.9+*, *nvim v0.1.2*.
Let's assume you are about to install neovim from scratch.
1. Install `neovim` using `brew install neovim/neovim/neovim`  
2. Install `python3` using `brew install python3` (needed to run [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim))  
3. Install neovim's python support using `pip3 install neovim`  
4. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/soyoh/ultinvim.git ~/.config/nvim`  
5. run `mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/backup`  
6. run `nvim +PlugInstall +q` to install plugins and then `nvim` to run nvim with installed plugins  
7. Enjoy your new `nvim` :bowtie:
